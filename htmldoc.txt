DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTML ELEMENTS
Semantic HTML elements: 
These elements simply mean, elements with meaning. The reason being, there definition in the code tells the browser and the developer what they are supposed to do. Framing in simpler words, these elements describe the type of content they are supposed to contain. Examples of Semantic HTML elements; article, aside, main, footer, header, nav, section e.t.

Non-Semantic HTML elements:
Unlike, semantic elements they do not have any meaning. They do not tell anything about the content they contain. They can be used with different attributes to mark up semantics common to a group.


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SELF-CLOSING TAGS AND NON-SELF CLOSING TAGS
Self-closing tags like link, br, img can not contain any other elements just attributes so there is no need to make them something else. Non-self closing like div, span, h1 can contain other elements and of course take attributes because they are non-self closing tags.


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INLINE ELEMENTS AND BLOCK ELEMENTS
Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element. Block elements have top and bottom margins.Inline elements do not have a top and bottom margin.
